## Manual Currency Converter 

This is a simple manual currency converter web app built with **React** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend.  
It allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another using **manually defined exchange rates** â€” no external API needed.

---

##  **How It Works**

- **Frontend**: Built with React â€” provides an interactive UI for users to select currencies, enter an amount, and see the converted value instantly.
- **Backend**: Built with Flask â€” serves conversion logic and a currency list using fixed exchange rates defined in Python.
- Uses **CORS** to allow the React app to communicate with the Flask server.
